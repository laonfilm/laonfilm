# About

LAonFilm is a love letter to Los Angeles, captured on instant film with a vintage [**Hasselblad 500cm**](https://www.hasselblad.com/about/history/500-series/) camera.

Each image was made using this classic medium-format camera from the 1970s, fitted with the ingenious [HassyPB](https://www.hassypb.com) back. This allows the Hasselblad to shoot [**Fujifilm Instax Square**](https://www.fujifilm.com/us/en/consumer/instax/film/square-film)  instant film, transforming every frame into a one-of-a-kind Polaroid-style print. It’s a blend of studio-quality craftsmanship and the immediacy of instant photography.  

The focus is simple: to slow down, shoot intentionally, and celebrate the historical, kitschy, fun, and beautiful places that make Los Angeles unique.  

This project is a handmade archive of LA’s spirit — past, present, and timeless.
